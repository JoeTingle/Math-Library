# C++ Math Library

## About
This is a C++ math and utility program that i created for use in another project but have carried on developing over time, you can see below in the UML diagram what exactly it contains. 

There are many standard math libraries around, especially in C / C++ but i wanted to create something that i would be able to customise and add to easily if and when i wanted to. Where as customising a third party library would be more difficult.
